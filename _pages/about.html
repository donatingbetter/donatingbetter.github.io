I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet health system needs while minimising harm to donors. I'm funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank">(NIHR)</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.cardiovascular.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-lois-kim" target="_blank">Dr Lois Kim</a>, and advised by <a href="https://www.donorhealth-btru.nihr.ac.uk/contact/dr-stephen-kaptoge/" target="_blank">Dr Stephen Kaptoge</a>.
