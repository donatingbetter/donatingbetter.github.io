  <summary><b>Weekly update</b> [11/01/2025] </summary>
<!------->
<p>This week, I've attempted to improve a statistical model I've been fitting for a simulation study, cut down the word count of a manuscript I'm preparing to send to co-authors, and take some bad initial ideas about thesis chapters out of the running. I've also written up some plans for a public engagement activity happening this spring ðŸŽ‰</p>
