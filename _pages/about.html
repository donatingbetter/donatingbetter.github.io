  <summary><b>Weekly update</b> [28/12/2024] </summary>
<!------->
<p>This week, I've been identifying and patching up holes in a handful of research proposals. In general, I'm using this brief period of email silence to reflect on and improve the work I've done so far and the work I'm planning to do. I've also cooked some corkscrew-like pasta gifted by generous neighbours who recently travelled to Italy.</p>
