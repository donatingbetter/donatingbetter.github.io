<p>
In my day job, I investigate <b>blood donor safety</b> in the English context. And on evenings and weekends, I contribute to an international collaboration within the nascent field of <b>arts and health</b>. I've found that these areas aren't as disparate as they seem - both focus on stewarding acts, and actors, that build community and serve others. Please read more below!

  <summary><b>How does viewing visual art impact our wellbeing?</b> May 2024 - present </summary>
<!------->
  A growing number of studies show that making art is good for our health, but we know much less about the evidence landscape surrounding how viewing visual art (i.e., "receptive engagement") could impact our wellbeing. That's why I, together with a research team led by <a href="https://www.jameelartshealthlab.org/about/our-team/marcel-foster">Marcel Foster</a>, am scoping the global literature on this question. I've supported our team in searching for, screening, extracting data from, and synthesising the available evidence, and I'm looking forward to sharing our outputs. In the meantime,  
<a href="https://osf.io/mync8">here</a>'s the protocol for our scoping review.
