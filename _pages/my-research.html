In my day job, I investigate <b>blood donor safety</b> in the English context. And on evenings and weekends, I contribute to an international collaboration within the nascent field of <b>arts and health</b>.

Together with a research team led by <a href="https://www.jameelartshealthlab.org/about/our-team/marcel-foster">Marcel Foster</a>, I'm scoping the global literature on this question. Since May 2024, I've searched academic and non-academic databases for relevant evidence, screened potentially eligible studies, extracted data from included studies, synthesised what we've found, and critically reviewed manuscript drafts. I'm looking forward to sharing our outputs - in the meantime,
