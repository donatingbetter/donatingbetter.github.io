I am now in my second year of a PhD in blood donor health at the University of Cambridge, where I am funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, supervised by Dr Lois Kim, and advised by Dr Stephen Kaptoge. I work full-time on my PhD and part-time on other research projects that interest me. Please read more below!

  <summary><b>What are the risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation?</b> Nov 2023 - Nov 2024</summary>
<!------->
Though giving blood is generally safe, <5% of donations result in donors feeling faint or fainting. Individual studies have examined risk factors for this complication, but we know little about the consistency and quality of associations found. For my first PhD project, I reviewed the literature on this topic and synthesised the published evidence using both quantitative and narrative methods. This work has now been published with the generous support of my supervisors and colleagues - please see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/trf.18078" target="_blank">here</a>!

  <summary><b>Why does donation history affect blood donors' risk of feeling faint?</b> Jan 2024 - present</summary>
<!------->
Our review (see above toggle) identified first-time donor status and previous faints as important risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation. However, we know little about why these characteristics, known collectively as "donation history", impact someone's risk of feeling faint. For my second PhD project, I analysed data from 60 thousand English blood donors to find out whether psychological responses to donation explained these differences in risk. This work has been presented as a poster during the 2024 British Blood Transfusion Society conference - please see <a href="https://yaning-wu.github.io/files/bbts-2024-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>!

  <summary><b>How does viewing visual art impact our wellbeing?</b> May 2024 - present </summary>
<!------->
  <p>A growing number of studies show that making art is good for our health, but we know little about the evidence landscape surrounding how viewing visual art (i.e., "receptive engagement") could impact our wellbeing. Together with a research team led by <a href="https://www.jameelartshealthlab.org/about/our-team/marcel-foster" target="_blank">Marcel Foster</a>, I'm scoping the global literature on this question. Since May 2024, I've searched academic and non-academic databases for relevant evidence, screened potentially eligible studies, extracted data from included studies, synthesised what we've found, and critically reviewed manuscript drafts. I'm looking forward to sharing our outputs - in the meantime,  
<a href="https://osf.io/mync8" target="_blank">here</a>'s the pre-registered protocol for our scoping review!</p>
