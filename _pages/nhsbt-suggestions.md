Since starting my PhD, I have grown interested in how blood services communicate with various publics about the donation process, its health impacts, and donor eligibility. Here are the changes that NHSBT (the English blood service) has implemented as a result of my feedback.

* 10/2023: Removing "wheelchair-bound" from [this](https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/the-donor/o-negative-donors-part-of-the-first-responders-team/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} feature about the lifesaving impact of O-negative donors
* 04/2024: Clarifying guidance surrounding post-donation exercise on [this](https://my.blood.co.uk/your-account/eligibility/health/article/?id=015&title=Exercise%2FSport){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} page about donor eligibility
* 05/2024: Clarifying guidance surrounding who may be at risk of deep vein thromboses (DVTs) following blood donation in NHSBT's [donor consent booklet](https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/23778/2122-0067-donor-consent-information-leaflet-blood-final.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a resource distributed at donation appointments nationwide (in progress!)
* 08/2024: Modifying public-facing guidance on [this](https://www.blood.co.uk/the-donation-process/children-at-donation-venues/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} page about bringing children to donation sessions in line with updated UK-wide legislation
