to <b>keep myself accountable</b> to my research, my team, and wider academic, donor, and patient communities, I will be posting regular updates on my PhD work. 
<br>
<br>
each week, I'll also post a few <b>recordings of my piano playing</b> at the Royal Papworth Hospital, which is adjacent to my office. if you enjoy my music, please give to the Royal Papworth Charity <a href="https://royalpapworthcharity.com/donate-online" target="_blank">here</a>!
