<p>
I am in the second year (out of three I hope!) of my PhD, and I am broadly investigating the short- and long-term impacts of donating whole blood on donors' health. Here, you can find out more about my published work, as well as the teaching and service that forms part of my doctoral experience. I am fortunate to be funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), supervised by Dr Lois Kim, and advised by Dr Stephen Kaptoge. You can read more about our research group <a href="https://www.donorhealth-btru.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>!

  <summary><b>What are the risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation?</b></summary>

<p>Though giving blood is generally safe, <5% of donations result in donors feeling faint or fainting. Individual studies have examined risk factors for this side effect, but we know little about the consistency and quality of the evidence for these risk factors. For my first PhD project, I reviewed the literature on this topic and synthesised the published evidence using both statistical and narrative methods.</p>

  <summary><b>Why does donation history affect blood donors' risk of feeling faint?</b></summary>

<p>Our review (see above toggle) identified first-time donor status and previous faints as important risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation. However, we know little about why these characteristics, known collectively as "donation history", impact someone's risk of feeling faint. For my second PhD project, I analysed data from 60 thousand English blood donors to find out whether psychological responses to donation explained these differences in risk.</p>
