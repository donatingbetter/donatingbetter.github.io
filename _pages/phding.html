I am in the second year (out of three I hope!) of my PhD, and I am fortunate to be supervised by Dr Lois Kim and advised by Dr Stephen Kaptoge. You can read more about our research group <a href="https://www.donorhealth-btru.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>!

  <summary><b>What are the risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation?</b> Nov 2023 - Nov 2024</summary>
<!------->
Though giving blood is generally safe, <5% of donations result in donors feeling faint or fainting. Individual studies have examined risk factors for this complication, but we know little about the consistency and quality of associations found. For my first PhD project, I reviewed the literature on this topic and synthesised the published evidence using both quantitative and narrative methods. This work has now been published with the generous support of my supervisors and colleagues - please see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/trf.18078" target="_blank">here</a>!

  <summary><b>Why does donation history affect blood donors' risk of feeling faint?</b> Jan 2024 - present</summary>
<!------->
Our review (see above toggle) identified first-time donor status and previous faints as important risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation. However, we know little about why these characteristics, known collectively as "donation history", impact someone's risk of feeling faint. For my second PhD project, I analysed data from 60 thousand English blood donors to find out whether psychological responses to donation explained these differences in risk. This work has been presented as a poster during the 2024 British Blood Transfusion Society conference - please see <a href="https://yaning-wu.github.io/files/bbts-2024-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>!
