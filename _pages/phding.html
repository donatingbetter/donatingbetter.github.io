<p>I am in the second year (out of three I hope!) of my PhD, and I am broadly investigating the short- and long-term health impacts of donating whole blood. Here, you can find out more about my published work, as well as the teaching and service that forms part of my doctoral experience.</p>

<p>I am fortunate to be funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), supervised by Dr Lois Kim, and advised by Dr Stephen Kaptoge. You can read more about our research group <a href="https://www.donorhealth-btru.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<p>Though giving blood is generally safe, <5% of donations result in donors feeling faint or fainting. Individual studies have examined risk factors for this side effect, but we know little about the consistency and quality of the evidence for these risk factors. For my first PhD project, I reviewed the literature on this topic and synthesised the published evidence using both statistical and narrative methods.</p>
<p>I previously presented this work at a campus "Research Celebration" event in April 2024 and a departmental PhD student seminar series in June 2024.</p>

  <summary><b>Why does donation history affect blood donors' risk of feeling faint?</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>Wu Y, Kim LG. Donation frequency and vasovagal reactions in English whole blood donors: Associations and mechanisms. Poster presented at: The Annual British Blood Transfusion Society Conference; 2024 Sep 17-19; Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
<p>Our review (see above toggle) identified first-time donor status and previous faints as important risk factors for feeling faint during or after blood donation. However, we know little about why these characteristics, known collectively as "donation history", impact someone's risk of feeling faint. For my second PhD project, I analysed data from 60 thousand English blood donors to find out whether psychological responses to donation explained these differences in risk.</p>
<p>I have also presented this work at a <a href="https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Public Health</a> networking event in May 2024, a McMenemy Seminar at my college, Trinity Hall, in November 2024, and a work-in-progress seminar within my research unit in November 2024.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<details>
  <summary><b>Undergraduate courses</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I currently supervise first-year medical students in <a href="https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/VetST/Current/Course/Years1and2/febp" target="_blank">Foundations of Evidence-Based Practice</a>. In Cambridge, supervisions are small-group teaching sessions where learners discuss lecture content and its real-world applications with someone already working in their field of study.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Postgraduate courses</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I currently serve as a teaching assistant and exam grader for statistics and epidemiology modules within the <a href="https://www.phs.group.cam.ac.uk/mphil-population-health-sciences/" target="_blank">MPhil in Population Health Sciences</a>.</p>
</details>

<h2>Service</h2>
<details>
  <summary><b>Peer review</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I currently serve as a peer reviewer for donor-health-related articles submitted to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14230410" target="_blank">Vox Sanguinis</a>, the flagship journal of the International Society of Blood Transfusion.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Departmental committees</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I currently serve as the co-chair of my department's PhD student committee and am also a member of my departmental equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) committee. In 2024, I supported the organising of my research unit's away day.</p>
</details>

<h2>Public engagement</h2>
<details>
  <summary><b>Festivals and open days</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I am developing an activity for the 2025 <a href="https://www.festival.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Festival</a>, a multi-day event across the city that invites local publics to engage with university-hosted research. I previously organised (see <a href="https://www.festival.cam.ac.uk/events/what-rest-break-or-interval-right-you-racing-blood-donor" target="_blank">here</a>) and volunteered for three activities during the 2024 iteration of the same festival. I have also volunteered at local charity Abbey People's <a href="https://abbeypeople.org.uk/eager-explorers/" target="_blank">Eager Explorers</a> event, which shared university research with children and families.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Schools and young people</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I currently volunteer with <a href="https://imascientist.org.uk/" target="_blank">I'm a Scientist</a>, which gives me the chance to chat with primary and secondary school students about careers in science. I also serve as a Student Ambassador for my college, Trinity Hall, which allows me to give tours and Q&As to prospective students from diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.</p>

  <summary><b>Science communication</b></summary>
<!------->
<p>I was a 2024 East of England finalist for <a href="https://www.cheltenhamfestivals.org/our-projects/famelab" target="_blank">Famelab</a>, a science communication competition that invites early-career researchers to speak for three minutes about their research to diverse audiences.</p>
