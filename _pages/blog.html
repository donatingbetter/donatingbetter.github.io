to keep myself accountable to the communities I serve, I'll be posting regular updates on my PhD work. I'll also make goals for each coming week and share a little about my life outside the lab, because there's always something else going on :)


to <b>keep myself accountable</b> to my team and wider academic, donor, and patient communities, I'll be posting regular updates on my PhD work. 

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
