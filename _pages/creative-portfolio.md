  <summary style="margin-left:2em"><b>- there is the home key</b> april 2023</summary> 
  <p style="margin-left:4em">
  <br>
I struck my first note and the room’s silence swelled<br>
from the antiseptic dispenser hazard-red on the wall<br> 
to the reception’s almost-spring bouquets – there<br>
you were cradling your coffee cup with not a word<br>
to each other or me and I tuned and wondered<br>
how you knew her and if you awoke together<br>
and for how long and who you kept vigil for<br>
and how to spell their name and how you<br>
spoke the name only you knew them by<br>
and where sundays mostly found them.<br>

During the chorus I looked up – there<br>
you were holding your little one up high<br>
and our eyes drew together and I sparkled<br>
with mine and I turned the page wondering<br>
how many nursery rhymes covered the miles<br>
to here where he sits taller than your sighs<br>
on your shoulders ever-enchanted by your<br>
smiling bright and what that smile had<br> 
swallowed from words too wide<br> 
to unknowns that seemed always wider.<br>

I reached the softest section – there<br>
you were as the double doors gave way<br>
to the figures who carried you into their<br>
flashing carriage in the middle of supper<br>
with your reading specs and today’s paper<br>
and I let the strings ring and wondered<br>
what the table you just set was like —<br>
the one they wrested you from tonight<br>
as you sat in garments you thought<br>
only your home would keep in sight.<br>

In a music theory class I left long ago<br>
they called home the key you depart from<br> 
and the one landing your stories safe so<br>
let me stop my wondering and tell this story<br>
so this hazard-red room may feel like another<br>
and if you listen for a second with a stranger<br>
I may stop your unknowns from growing wider<br>
and when I strike my last note in the final measure<br>
to dismiss the wailing carriages that flicker – there<br>
is the home key and we will come home together.
