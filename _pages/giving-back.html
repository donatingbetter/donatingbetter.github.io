<p>Voluntary work has been an important part of my life since the COVID-19 pandemic, when a temporary role blossomed into three years of moving inspiration and connection that would prove vital to my career plans. Nowadays, my volunteering is usually unrelated to my day job. Find out more below!</p>

  <summary>Synthesising the impact of viewing visual art on wellbeing</summary>
<!------->
  <p>A growing number of studies show that making art is good for our health, but we know little about the evidence landscape surrounding how viewing visual art (i.e., "receptive engagement") could impact our wellbeing. Since May 2024, I've served in a research team based at the NYU- and WHO-affiliated <a href="https://www.jameelartshealthlab.org/" target="_blank">Jameel Arts and Health Lab</a> to survey the global literature on this question. I've searched academic and non-academic databases for relevant evidence, screened potentially eligible studies, extracted and synthesised data, and critically reviewed manuscript drafts. I'm looking forward to sharing our outputs - in the meantime,

  <summary>Synthesising barriers and facilitators to acute care for sickle cell disease</summary>
<!------->
  <p>Sickle cell disease is a genetic condition that affects a growing number of UK residents and their families and communities. Care-seeking for this oft-stigmatised condition can be challenging, but we know little about the specific barriers and facilitators of seeking acute help in UK-based patients. Since October 2023, I've co-led a research team with students and staff from the University of Brighton's <a href="https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/donorresearch/" target="_blank">Donor Research Team</a> to synthesise the local literature on this question. I've searched academic databases for relevant evidence, screened potentially eligible studies, extracted and synthesised data, and co-authored iterative manuscript drafts. I'm looking forward to sharing our outputs - in the meantime, <a href="https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023478012" target="_blank">here</a>'s the pre-registered protocol for our systematic review!</p>

<h2>Community and connection</h2>
<details>
  <summary>Talking through (but rarely about) cancer</summary>
<!------->
  <p>A cancer diagnosis can be an isolating experience, even with the support of loved ones. Since March 2023, I have served as a Telephone Buddy with <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/" target="_blank">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>, giving me the chance to build rapport with people around the country and converse through (but rarely about) cancer. I have "matched" with three people so far for around 12 hour-long chats each!</p>

<h2>Education and outreach</h2>
<details>
  <summary>Spreading the word about inspiring public lectures</summary>
<!------->
  <p>Good research produces interesting insights, but brilliant research makes an impact on lives and communities. Since December 2023, I have supported the <a href="https://www.csar.org.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Society for the Application of Research</a> to reach wider audiences with its hybrid lectures on the application of leading research delivered by senior academics and early-career researchers alike. To do this, I have grown the charity's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/100780558/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> presence and revamped its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@csarlectures/videos" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> to help align thumbnails with brand guidelines.</p>
