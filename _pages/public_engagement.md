I often blur the lines between my identities as a researcher, a patient, and a member of the public. Here are some of my experiences navigating those identities in and outside of academia! 

### as a patient/public contributor
* Josh Wiggett + RNOH PPIE
* SAUK guest articles
* CG Scolio
* Arts Council England play

### as a researcher
* WordSmith
* emBRACE (defunct)

### as a community organiser
* Blossoming Wards

### as an artist and designer
* MedSupplyDrive UK
* Portraits For PPE
* Bridge India
* blood donor advocacy
