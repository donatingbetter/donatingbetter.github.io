I often ponder what defines a member of the public, a patient, and a researcher or "expert" ... 

I can never be sure, and I blur those lines myself. What I do know, though, is that public engagement skills are crucial for any researcher, so here are some of my experiences working with diverse stakeholders in and outside of academia.
