I become a keeper, sharer, or recipient of knowledge depending on my environment. As I continue reflecting the power these identities hold, here's some information about my public engagement experience. I intend to continue **working with diverse stakeholders during my doctoral studies to improve the impact and accessibility of my research**.

### As a product designer
* As the co-founder of <b>[WordSmith](https://www.wordsmithtech.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b>, an app for people with word-retrieval difficulties caused by stroke, dementia, or learning disability, I spoke with potential users and speech and language therapists to learn about what they value in assistive technology software. With a volunteer team, I then implemented this feedback into our iterating prototypes. 
* For a digital health module during my undergraduate studies, I ideated <b>emBRACE</b>, a software helping adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients to customise their orthotics. When considering whether I should make the technology come to life, I spoke to patients, families, and clinicians about the challenges they face with treatment adherence. Through these conversations, I realised that my idea wouldn't fill a pressing or prevalent need and therefore halted its development.

### As a science communicator
* I took on the role of social media lead at <b>[MedSupplyDrive UK](https://www.medsupplydrive.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b>, a charity borne from the need to supply healthcare workers in the UK with protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020. Through my work, I shared accessible information about infection risk and prevention, the environmental effects of medical waste, and the outbreak's impact on healthcare workers and systems. For a short stint in 2021, I also mentored a group of secondary school students for their virtual work experience and demonstrated to them key skills in information presentation, design, and social media marketing.
* Inspired by my aforementioned social media work, I started <b>[Portraits for PPE](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJl1uUthWFi/?img_index=1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b>, an Instagram page documenting the stories of UK health and social care staff who have died from COVID-19. The greatest challenge of this project was juggling sensitivity towards the loved ones of those portrayed while emphasising the importance of protecting these frontline workers to those who could affect real policy change. 
* At the height of India's second COVID-19 wave, I volunteered with the nonprofit thinktank <b>[Bridge India](https://www.bridgeindia.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b> to design [graphics](https://www.instagram.com/p/COvLEwdnPze/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for social media. By clarifying the scale and human impact of the crisis, my goal was to encourage donations towards the thinktank's grassroots charity initiatives.

### As an instructor
* With a Â£500 grant from Oxford Hub during my MSc, I ran a project called <b>[Blossoming Wards](https://blossomingwards.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b> that delivered art from the public to patients at local hospitals. I facilitated at least an hour of art workshops weekly, guiding local residents with varying levels of experience to produce pieces they could be proud of. For more details about the project, read our impact report [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7104204730624524288/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}!

### As a patient/member of the public
* Since my scoliosis diagnosis as a teen, I have engaged with researchers, clinicians, and artists to enhance the patient impact of their work.
  * in secondary school, I facilitated support groups for young women with the same diagnosis in Kenya, discussing issues of self-esteem and treatment access to find solutions together.
  * during my undergraduate degree, I interviewed Dr Nachiappan Chockalingam for the British Scoliosis Research Foundation's [magazine](https://sauk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Backbone-103.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} about his investigation of the biomechanics of scoliosis and its translations to clinical settings.
  * since June 2023, I have assisted in the development of ["Shooting Pains"](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=658446682975921&set=a.390196863134239){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a play about a young woman growing up with scoliosis. I've given feedback on nascent versions of the play and advised its creative team about the inclusion of diverse scoliosis narratives.
  * most recently, I have been a patient contributor to scoliosis studies based at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.
* As a regular blood donor and a participant in the [STRIDES](https://www.strides-study.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} study, I advocate for donor registration regularly through my own social networks. For example, after my first donation, I produced [this](https://wmjlwuh.medium.com/i-did-it-for-the-chocolate-dbca8c7c0f83){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} infographic to inform others (especially young people) about the light-hearted side of the donation process.
* I participate periodically in focus groups run by Impero Research, an advertising agency creating fundraising campaigns for the [Great Ormond Street Charity](https://www.gosh.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Together with other members of the public involved with the voluntary sector, I provide the agency with feedback about the tone and design of their ads.
