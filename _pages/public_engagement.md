I become a keeper, sharer, or recipient of scientific knowledge depending on my environment. As I continue reflecting the power these identities hold, here's some information about my public engagement experience.

### as a researcher
* as the co-founder of <b>[WordSmith](https://www.wordsmithtech.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b>, an app for people with word-retrieval difficulties caused by stroke, dementia, or learning disability, I spoke with potential users and speech and language therapists to learn about what they value in assistive technology software. With a volunteer team, I then implemented this feedback into our iterating prototypes. 
* during a digital health module during my undergraduate studies, I ideated <b>emBRACE</b>, a software helping adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients to customise their orthotics. When considering whether I should make the technology come to life, I spoke to patients, families, and clinicians about the challenges they face with treatment adherence. Through these conversations, I realised that my idea wouldn't fill a pressing or prevalent need and therefore halted its development.

### as a science communicator
* I took on the role of social media lead at <b>[MedSupplyDrive UK](https://www.medsupplydrive.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b>, a charity borne from the need to supply healthcare workers in the UK with protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020. Through my work, I shared accessible information about infection risk and prevention, the environmental effects of medical waste, and the outbreak's impact on healthcare workers and systems. For a short stint in 2021, I also mentored a group of secondary school students for their virtual work experience and demonstrated to them key skills in information presentation, design, and social media marketing.
* inspired by my aforementioned social media work, I started <b>[Portraits for PPE](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJl1uUthWFi/?img_index=1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b>, an Instagram page documenting the stories of UK health and social care staff who have died from COVID-19. The greatest challenge of this project was juggling sensitivity towards the loved ones of those portrayed while emphasising the importance of higher-quality protection to those who could affect real policy change. 
* at the height of India's second COVID-19 wave, I volunteered with the nonprofit thinktank <b>[Bridge India](https://www.bridgeindia.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b> to design [graphics](https://www.instagram.com/p/COvLEwdnPze/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for social media. By clarifying the scale and human impact of the crisis, my goal was to encourage donations towards the thinktank's grassroots charity initiatives.

### as an instructor
* With a Â£500 grant from Oxford Hub during my MSc, I ran a project called <b>[Blossoming Wards](https://blossomingwards.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</b> that delivered art from the public to patients at local hospitals. I facilitated at least an hour of art workshops weekly, guiding local residents with varying levels of experience to produce pieces they could be proud of.
