I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet healthcare system needs while keeping donors well. I'm supervised by [Prof Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR)'s [Blood and Transplant Research Unit](https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/research-and-development/current-research/btrus/donor-health-and-behaviour/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the same body that funds my studies.

You can find out more about my academic and professional background [here](https://donatingbetter.github.io/cv/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as well as on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaning-wu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Outside of research, my creative work forms the most significant part of my life. You can find my art, writing, and design projects [here](https://donatingbetter.github.io/creative-portfolio/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
