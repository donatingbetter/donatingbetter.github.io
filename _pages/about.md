I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet healthcare system needs while keeping donors well. I'm supervised by [Prof Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/) at the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR)'s [Blood and Transplant Research Unit](https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/research-and-development/current-research/btrus/donor-health-and-behaviour/), the same body that funds my studies.

I previously studied for a [BSc in Population Health Sciences](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/population-health-sciences-bsc) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and an [MSc in Global Health Science and Epidemiology](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-global-health-science-and-epidemiology) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).
