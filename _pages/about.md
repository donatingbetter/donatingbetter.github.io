I'm **Yaning** (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can **tailor blood donation processes** to **meet health system needs while minimising harm to donors**. I'm funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research [(**NIHR**)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and supervised by [**Dr Lois Kim**](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-research-staff/lois-kim/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

You can learn more about my **academic**, **professional**, and **creative background** by exploring this site. If you'd like to discuss a potential collaboration, seek guidance for graduate school applications, or talk about the weather, please **book a virtual meeting with me** [here](https://calendly.com/yaningwu/30min){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you're looking for a bit of a breather, you can find my recordings of **piano music** from our local hospital [here](https://yaning-wu.github.io/music-at-rph/)!

If you're in Cambridge, come say hi at the **Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart and Lung Research Institute** ([HLRI](https://www.hlri.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) on the Biomedical Campus üòÄ ‚¨áÔ∏è
