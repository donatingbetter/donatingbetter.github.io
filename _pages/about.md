I'm **Yaning** (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet health system needs while minimising harm to donors. I'm funded by the [National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and supervised by [Prof Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Dr Lois Kim](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-research-staff/lois-kim/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

You can learn more about my **academic**, **professional**, and **creative** background by exploring this site. If you'd like to discuss a potential collaboration, seek guidance for graduate school applications, or talk about the weather, please book a virtual meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/yaningwu/30min){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

If you're in Cambridge, come say hi at the Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart and Lung Research Institute ([HLRI](https://www.hlri.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) on the Biomedical Campus üòÄ ‚¨áÔ∏è

P.S. I play the piano at the nearby Royal Papworth Hospital weekly and will be updating [this](https://yaning-wu.github.io/piano-rph/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} page regularly with recordings.
