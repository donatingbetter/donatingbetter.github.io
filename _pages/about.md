I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet health system needs while minimising harm to donors. I'm funded by the [National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and supervised by [Prof Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

You can find out more about my academic and professional background [here](https://donatingbetter.github.io/cv/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as well as on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaning-wu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Outside of research, my creative work forms the most significant part of my life. You can find my art, design, and storytelling projects [here](https://donatingbetter.github.io/creative-portfolio/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
