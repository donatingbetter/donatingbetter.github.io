I'm **Yaning** (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. My research examines how we can tailor blood donation processes to meet health system needs while minimising harm to donors. I'm funded by the [National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and supervised by [Prof Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Dr Lois Kim](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-research-staff/lois-kim/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

You can learn more about my **academic**, **professional**, and **creative** background by exploring this site. If you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, make a suggestion, or talk about the weather, please get in touch via the sidebar links!
