this week
------
Whew, that was tough! I have been focussing on incorporating the feedback of four senior co-authors for my systematic review and meta-analysis this week, which has been a rollercoaster (but a rewarding one that I'm grateful to embark on). I am nearly ready to send my revised version for final comments next week. Fingers crossed! I have also continued to iterate my poster for my Glasgow 2024 conference, which still looks terrible but has, at least, several more terrible versions than before.

next week
------
I intend to spend the next week finalising my first-year report, which is due in the first week of August, and developing the primary research proposals I've been neglecting in the past week.

I took a spontaneous (and I mean 15-minutes-before-it-happened spontaneous) vacation to a nearby village, Ely, on Tuesday and spent some much-needed time in its hills, cathedral surrounds, and quiet high street shops. Also, I had the pleasure of catching the last half an hour of the Paris 2024 opening ceremony! This is the first Olympic Games that I'll be able to watch live, and I look forward to procrastinating as a result ...

A "blood van" passing through the Biomedical Campus. England had a blood supply "Amber alert" a few days ago, but luckily, generous public response to call-outs by local media and by various health authorities has begun to replenish supplies. However, this alert will remain in place for the next four weeks as clinical services continue to adjust.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
