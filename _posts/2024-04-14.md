this week
------
Silly me! I spent longer than expected this week fixing mistakes I had made in describing my results. I also ruled out a lot of analyses that I had originally proposed (at least there were some decisions made). At the same time, I spent valuable time interrogating the best measures to use for donor health outcomes, as well as developing some primitive methods work I had begun alongside the drafting of my systematic review and meta-analysis.

next week
------
I'm looking forward to engaging with blood donation researchers from around the world via a steering committee meeting next Monday! Next week also marks the return of a more "normal" working pattern as more team members return from holidays abroad. I'll brainstorm some ideas about donation safety with a colleague, inspired by a recent Nature Immunology publication, and do some more reading about advanced methods for determining who benefits most from interventions randomised across place and time.

There hasn't been much going on this week. However, a big milestone happened a few days ago: the shutting down of MedSupplyDrive UK, the charity that I've volunteered with ever since the first UK COVID-19-induced lockdown in March 2020. The team means a lot to me, and I am ever-grateful for our time together and ambition, hope, and invaluable communications experience it brought me during those strange and challenging years.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
