this week
------
I continued to refine my meta-analysis this week, producing tables and plots for each section. I learned more about methods for making effect estimation more conservative in the face of substantial differences between studies. I also met a long-time collaborator of our research group and discussed future study directions.

next week
------
I want to find the answers to several methods questions for my meta-analysis and describe the rationale for my methodological choices. I also want to finalise my results presentations, generating more outputs than I may include in my thesis. Finally, I want to finalise my statistical analysis plan for upcoming work with primary data.

outside the lab

I watched our college's production of "Merrily We Roll Along", a musical about holding on to friendship through life's challenges. I also took part in my apartment block's step count competition, which I doubt I'll win, but I enjoyed trying :)

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
