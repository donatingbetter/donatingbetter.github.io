this week

NEW DATA ALERT! This week, I received the data I'd requested - good timing. I confirmed my study analysis plans for a few days before opening the dataset and beginning to clean it using the statistical software R. Then, I cleaned up results presentations and interpretations for my systematic review and meta-analysis. Finally, I met with senior colleagues to discuss a possible new collaboration to enhance the application of our blood donor datasets to broader health research questions.

I want to wrap up the first draft of my systematic review and meta-analysis, filling in those X's, highlighted ...'s, and blanks I've left on my documents. I also want to complete data cleaning for my primary analysis and begin describing the study population I'm working with. I can't name the participants, but I've likely met a few by coincidence and I'm sure they're lovely - that's one way I can already describe them. Finally, I'm hoping to re-organise my life in a way that better prioritises what I care about and leaves me some space to rest. Big ambitions this time round ...

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
