this week
------
Whew ... it's getting late. It's almost bedtime and I'm still on my work computer! I would never consider this acceptable normally but have made an exception for this chaotic week. I've continued to respond to my supervisor's comments on my primary analyses, realising that I will need to make substantial changes to the variables used. I've also made a dummy dataset that enables me to test my simulation modelling code before I receive the "real" data ... though I haven't done most of that testing yet. And perhaps most importantly, I've submitted revisions for our systematic review manuscript, which has now been accepted for publication!!! I hope to share the published paper with you all within the next two weeks.

next week
------
Now that our systematic review behemoth is behind me, I'll be focussing on the projects ahead. Specifically, I'll be madly preparing to give a presentation to senior and junior colleagues alike on my PhD projects thus far (a behemoth in itself ... the presentation may last 30-45 minutes). I'll also attempt to finish a terrible manuscript draft for my primary analyses, though that will need changing if my analyses do too. Finally, I'll start to test my simulation modelling code in earnest after confirming that my dummy data makes sense.

A new colleague kindly invited us to breakfast at Christ's College during the week, which I immediately adored because of its wide variety of condiments (including my beloved Tabasco).

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
