this week
------
It's been a week of presentations! On Wednesday, I presented findings from my first primary analyses in an intimate setting and had a great conversation with the attendees. On Thursday, I presented to a larger audience, including senior scientists within the Department of Public Health and Primary Care. I've also built on my manuscript draft for that primary analysis, which I hope to share with my supervisor soon. I've also spent several hours trying to improve on a proposal for a simulation modelling analysis according to comments from my supervisor. Finally, I've been working through final admin procedures for our accepted review paper!

next week
------
It'll soon be time to talk to some impressionable young people ... Next Thursday will be my first stint as a seminar leader for a course for first-year medical students. I'll spend a few hours preparing for our session by reading through completed assignments (hopefully) submitted by those students. I'll also prepare a short presentation for blood donation research colleagues across England on Thursday, and I'll continue to improve my proposal and code for my planned simulation modelling analyses. Finally, I'll think through comments and questions from audiences at both of my presentations this week and use them to improve my work.

In a thrilling turn of events this Wednesday, a few fire trucks stopped outside my building and shut down traffic for around a block (everyone seemed to be okay). I managed to reconnect with an old neighbour who was, too, caught in disrupted transport, and we shared a quiet moment on the sidewalk before I rushed off in my high-heeled boots for my presentation.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
