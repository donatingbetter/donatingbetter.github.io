this week
------
I have some news ... it's unofficial, but I appear to have passed my first-year assessment! There is a good chance that I will be permitted to continue this adventure, albeit with some changes to my project plans. What an honour to have this opportunity to keep moving forward - I will think of this ruling in the days when I am constantly plagued by the inadequacy of my work. 

Anyway, this week, I kept revising my review manuscript according to co-author comments, developing my simulation modelling proposal (which is proving a mountain of a challenge), edited a proposal for a collaborative study with global blood service experts, and vetoed/delayed a bunch of overly ambitious ideas with the help of kind colleagues.

next week
------
I'm looking forward to implementing feedback from my first-year assessment and preparing (physically, emotionally, and cognitively :)) for my first-ever conference, which begins in around a week! Exciting times ahead.

I'm looking forward to visiting the town centre later today for an exhibition of art and gardening by unhoused people served by one of our local GP surgeries!

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
