this week
------
One of my earliest completed tasks this past Monday was to format the title page of my first-year report ... how productive. Anyway, I managed to finish the actual content of that report throughout the week and sent it off to my supervisor on Friday! It's pretty mammoth, and my next steps will be to think of questions that my assessors might ask after reading that work. I also spent the week outlining my poster for my Glasgow conference in September, which has already gone through several (unsightly) iterations - at least the Background and Methods sections are on their way to being complete. Alongside that, I've been trying to learn more about the methods I'm hoping to use for a simulation modelling study in the coming months, which are still causing me great confusion, but I'm optimistic that the outputs of that modelling will be worth the tedium. Finally, I'm proud to announce that I completed my first attempt at a peer review following an invitation by a senior colleague in the transfusion medicine space! I'll work with my supervisor to refine my review before submitting it next week. What a privilege to engage with wider academic community :)

next week
------
My work next week depends on the feedback of many others, so I'll stay relatively flexible for now. I do intend to refine my poster and my first-year report, as well as some proposals for future studies.

I had the delight of giving a college tour to some young people as a volunteer student ambassador during the week! The kids are alright.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
