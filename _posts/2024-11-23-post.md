this week
------
On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I drafted a data request for my proposed simulation study, led my first-ever undergraduate supervision meeting, presented my first primary analysis to a multidisciplinary audience of Blood and Transplant Unit researchers, and started running my simulation code using dummy data. Then, on Thursday, I cracked the screen of my work laptop, took a half-day to blunder around and despair, and spent the rest of the day starting a new job as a Research Associate at Kohlrabi, a public health consultancy. It's a privilege to join a team that clearly likes their greens :)

next week
------
I'll reorganise myself after this chaotic week, find a way to get my laptop repaired, and continue to finalise my data request for that simulation study. I'll also continue fleshing out the rationale and methods for a study involving longer-term follow-up of blood donors, as well as sending off fifteen Masters assessments that I graded this past week.

BIRTHDAY TIME! I tried to keep it quiet, but I had a bit of a wild weekend to celebrate with kind friends from disparate places. I could not be sleepier now but am very grateful for the wildness.

I had half of this volume of wine on Friday - moderation for the win.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
