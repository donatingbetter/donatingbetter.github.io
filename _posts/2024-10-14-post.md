this week
------
I'M BACK! After a period of annual leave from Oct 3-18, I've returned to Cambridge and am currently working from my college. In the few days before my travels and the day and a half since, I submitted our review paper for publication, made a lot of slide decks to share proposed ideas with my supervisor, fleshed out a manuscript version of my first primary analysis, and liaised with the undergraduate students who I'll be leading seminars for in a few weeks :) I kept an eye on emails while away, so I have little to catch up on on that front. I'm still reeling, though, from a pile of outstanding to-dos.

next week
------
My theme for next week will be "focus". I've realised that reducing the number of items on my to-do list creates more space for deep, productive work, though that's hard to do in practice! I find new areas that could merit my attention every day. Specifically, I hope to finalise proposals so that I can submit data access requests for analyses I've been planning for months, design slides for an upcoming presentation to my research group, and think further about some challenging statistical questions that have emerged from an ongoing analysis.

Everything's happened, really ... from Peking duck to hiking up the Great Wall. I'll need a moment to recover!

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
