this week
------
I've begun implementing some of the feedback from my first-year assessors, which has led to somewhat drastic (though sorely needed) changes to my proposed work. Broadly, though, I'm plowing forward, and am now trying to improve the fit of some models I would like to use for a discrete-event simulation. I also found some small errors in my code for my first primary analysis, so I have been working to correct those and improve that piece of work before I attempt to adapt it for journal submission. Finally, I met with international collaborators and presented a study proposal with short notice, receiving some interesting and useful feedback!

next week
------
CONFERENCE TIME! I'll be mostly off from Tuesday to Thursday while I attend the British Blood Transfusion Society's 2024 convening. I'm looking forward to engaging with transfusion professionals from diverse fields, especially those who work directly with the blood service. For the rest of the week (and whenever I have a free moment), I'll be moving forward with the design of that international collaborative study, improving existing analyses, and adding sophistication and clarity to my documentation of proposed work.

outside the lab

I attended our biomedical campus's wellbeing festival on Tuesday, which meant learning about poo, estimating the sugar content of common groceries, petting therapy dogs, measuring my reflexes, and observing CPR competitions.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
