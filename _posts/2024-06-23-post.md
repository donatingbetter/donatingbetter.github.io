this week
------
FREE PIZZA! Yes, there was free pizza when I presented my (non-PhD) work with colleagues part of the charity MedSupplyDrive UK at one of our newest campus buildings this week. And in the office, I continued plugging away with my primary analysis, which I had intended to finish writing up this week but which has grown in unexpected ways (and will therefore need some more time to finish ... ). On the bright side, I am making small but fascinating steps forward in developing other ideas using the data I currently have, as well as proposing work using data that I hope to apply to access in the next few months. My most urgent task, though, has been augmenting some analyses for my systematic review and meta-analysis according to the feedback of senior colleagues, which I hope to submit to a journal soon. 

next week

I've set myself deadlines in the beginning of July to (a) send off a revised version of my review manuscript to our authorship team and (b) send off a rough draft of my first primary analysis to my supervisor, so I'll continue to hone in on those mammoth works in the coming week. On the side, I'll be forming and developing several ideas (some of them outlandish).

I had the privilege of welcoming some Masters friends to Cambridge to try a gorgeous new restaurant in town :) I'll need to improve my Hindi so that I can read their signage and bathroom doors next time.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
