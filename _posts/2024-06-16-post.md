this week
------
I DID IT! I shared my first-year PhD work with interdisciplinary researchers at all levels in my department this Wednesday. It was a highly fulfilling experience (despite my going too fast while speaking), and I was lucky enough to receive kind feedback from colleagues and fellow PhDs. Most of the week was taken up by my preparations for, and delivery of, the presentation, but I also spent some time developing my interpretation of my primary analysis, which appears to be constantly changing ... 

next week
------
With my first-year presentation out of the way, it's almost time for me to hunker down and write my first-year report, a more formal assessment of my progress that will form the basis of a viva in September. That means that next week will be filled with writing up ... and I hope to report back here with a significant proportion of my analysis chapter completed.

I celebrated the Dragon Boat Festival this Monday with a dozen dumplings and a sticky rice dumpling filled with two jujubes. I'd invite anyone, regardless of cultural background, to join the celebrations every year!

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
