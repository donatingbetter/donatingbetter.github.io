this week
------
I ran some sensitivity analyses for my meta-analysis this week and learned why and how to implement heterogeneity measures. They're a bit of a pain to code, but I suspect the interpretation gains will be worth the effort! I also read, for the first time, about assessing small study effects (reduced in some papers to publication bias, but encompassing a broader set of causes of heterogeneity). Finally, I tried to devise clearer ways to present my mountain of results. That remains a work in progress. 

next week
------
I want to draft my interpretation of these results (probably terribly the first time around) and investigate what they might mean for further analyses. I also want to make a mind map of the disparate areas my subject brings together so that I can better plan future studies. This might include how certain risk factors, behaviours, and demographics relate to one another in the blood donor population.

outside the lab
------
I attended a few gatherings this week, including a birthday celebration, a student recital, and a meeting in the University's new-ish West Hub. The latter is a thriving space for collaboration that I want to use more often.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
