this week
------
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER! This week, I focussed on addressing the final comments of my co-authors on our systematic review and meta-analysis manuscript. In trying to get back to the flow of things after my week of "conference-holiday", I also made a million update slides about various proposed analyses for next week's supervision meeting ... Finally, I've been preparing to lead seminars for first-year undergraduate medical students by reading through lecture materials, attempting the quizzes they'll be asked to do, and wrapping my head around the logistics of the Cambridge system. 

next week

My biggest goal for next week will be to submit our manuscript. While it's been fun to work through, I am excited to move on to new things! I will also attempt to write up my first primary analysis for publication, despite not yet being sure what journal(s) I'll target. On Thursday, I'll go on leave to visit family for around two weeks, but I'm not yet sure whether that means actual leave or "checking-emails-every-hour" leave! I will do my best to make it the former. Please expect another update from me after I return.

My neighbours persuaded me to join them for our accommodation's pizza party this week, for which I was rewarded with a cup of cranberry juice mixed with water and two slices of Papa John's (not a sponsor). I was reminded that I should do more with these cool peeps.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
