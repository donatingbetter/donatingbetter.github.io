this week
------
I DID IT! I finally organised my dozens of bookmarked journal articles. Are you proud?

I also produced nascent "Introduction" and "Methods" drafts for my primary analysis and rewrote a few thousand words of my systematic review and meta-analysis write-up for journal publication. I realised that I waffle a lot, even for someone who likes waffles ... Finally, I met with senior researchers in my unit who provided valuable feedback on some of the future analyses I'm proposing.

next week
------
I'm hoping to get started with the main analysis portion of my current work, tabulating and describing those results. In view of the aforementioned feedback, I'll rewrite a proposal to analyse trial data. I'll continue reworking my review draft, too, to make sure I can disseminate it in good time!

Not too much going on this week ... though I am busy preparing for some public engagement events taking place in Cambridge over the next several weeks! More information coming soon.

The bus dropped me off a little ways away from my typical stop this Wednesday, leading me to this view ...

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
