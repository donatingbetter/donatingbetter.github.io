I attended a few gatherings this week, including a birthday celebration, a student recital, and a meeting in the University's new-ish West Hub. The latter is a thriving space for collaboration that I want to use more often.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
