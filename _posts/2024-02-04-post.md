this week
------
I improved the appearance and clarity of my forest plots for my meta-analysis today (they are a type of a plot that shows the results of different studies alongside each other, as well as a summary effect across those studies). I also wrote up my (very disorganised) interpretation of my findings for my thesis and for future publication. On the side, I'm preparing a manuscript with colleagues and planning primary analyses on a dataset of English blood donors.

next week
------
I want to improve the way I describe my results, especially for those studies that couldn't fit into my meta-analysis. I also want to access my primary dataset for the first time and decide what my next steps will be. Finally, I'd like to sort out my mountain of a reading list to refine my interpretation of my meta-analysis.

I visited our college's postgraduate accommodation block for the first time and received a warm welcome! I found the apartments clean and full of character. I'm jealous of their piano, too (even though I have the privilege to access some beautiful instruments myself). 

on the reading list

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
