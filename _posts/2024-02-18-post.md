this week
------
I finally produced a complete (bad) draft of my systematic review and meta-analysis this week, as well as using the Endnote extension in Word to generate proper references (future me will be grateful). I also combed through the data I received at the end of last week, performed some simple cleaning, and investigated missing values (which are common in questionnaire data). During that process, I made a few rudimentary results figures describing the study participants, which I hope to include in my final write-up after some modifications.

next week
------
I want to investigate associations between my variables of interest next week and advance my understanding of the more advanced statistical methods I'll need to conduct my main analyses. I also look forward to meeting with overseas colleagues who have collaborated with our group in the past to exchange ideas and learnings.

I was brave enough to sing and record Nick Drake's beloved "Northern Sky" this week (only for myself and any poor neighbours in earshot). And I made some progress on an entrepreneurship project I co-founded with friends.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
