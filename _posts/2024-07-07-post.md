this week
------
HECK YEAH! I submitted a revised version of my review manuscript to senior authors this Wednesday. And on Thursday, I submitted a thesis draft of my primary analysis to my supervisor. Those pieces of work are probably very rough, but I'm glad I got a lot of my thoughts and results on paper. This week has otherwise been a gradual exercise in compiling my first year report, whose word count I am learning is going to be a struggle to meet ...

next week
------
My work from now until around the end of July will be focused on preparing for my first year assessment, which means thinking deeply about everything I've done this year and picking out the most interesting parts. I also plan to throw myself in the deep end of simulation modelling methods as I weigh the opportunities and challenges of this type of analysis for my thesis.

outside the lab

I ventured to Churchill College for dinner on a rare outing out of the city centre today and encountered some unexpected adventures with flora and scenery with a colleague :) How lucky am I.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
