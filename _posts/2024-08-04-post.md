this week
------
HOME STRETCH ALERT! After approximately two rounds of revisions by collaborating authors, I've sent off my review manuscript for final comments. I hope to submit the manuscript to a transfusion-focussed journal this month (maybe that's ambitious ... ). I have managed, too, to complete the academic contents of my first-year report (i.e., not the acknowledgements). I've also been burying my head in simulation modelling papers and making notes about what my own study might look like, which will culminate in a presentation to my supervisor in around a week from today. Finally, I've made several more versions of my conference poster, which is looking slightly less terrible after I found a way to simplify my graphs and figures.

next week
------
It'll be all systems go next Thursday, when I submit my first-year report to my assessors. I'll then start preparations for my first-year assessment in earnest, which includes reading the pubications of those assessors to predict what they might ask ... I also look forward to creating even less terrible versions of my poster and hope to have a first draft ready by the end of the week.

Today is [ESTHER DAY](https://nerdfighteria.info/article/1103)! I spent some time last night saying the L-word to my people, and I hope you do the same.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
