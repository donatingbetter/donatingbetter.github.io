this week
------
I interpreted some results from my main analyses this week and conducted additional analyses to see whether those results remained the same under different conditions which may or may not be true (we make a lot of assumptions in epidemiology!). I also added some worked examples to the appendix of my systematic review and meta-analysis and made my figures a little neater for inclusion in the thesis. That's been a lot of my work this week - trying to understand where different pieces of research fit into my final product :)

next week
------
I want to continue developing my ideas to study a diverse range of health effects of blood donation. I am also keen to further investigate some ideas I got when speaking to non-scientist stakeholders, both loved ones and strangers! Finally, I want to re-organise some parts of my thesis to avoid repetition and enhance clarity.

I gave my recital on Wednesday! What an honour. You can find recordings [here](https://yaning-wu.github.io/recital-2024/). I also took part in two public engagement events, an [iftar dinner](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/thewesthub/1152086) interspersed with science and ethics and a [running race](https://www.festival.cam.ac.uk/events/what-rest-break-or-interval-right-you-racing-blood-donor) for families and children to simulate the design of a blood donation study.

about me
------
I'm Yaning (she/her), a PhD candidate in Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. I am working with colleagues in the Blood and Transplant Research Unit, the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, and NHS Blood and Transplant (England's national blood service) to improve the safety and efficiency of voluntary whole blood donation. I'm supervised by the amazing Dr Lois Kim and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. This is my blog about my journey through this candidature, starting from nine months before my transfer of status. Please feel free to reach out at yw645 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk!
